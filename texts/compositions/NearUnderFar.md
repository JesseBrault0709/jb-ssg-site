_Near, Under, Far_ is a response to Luc Tuymans’ painting _Die blaue Eiche_ (“The Blue Oak”). 
I was struck by both the loneliness and angularity of the painting, 
and sought to capture these two ideas musically.

As I was first sketching the piece, the region where I was living experienced extreme cold weather.
Standing outside one afternoon during this cold snap, I asked myself: what is the opposite of _Die blaue Eiche_? 
I imagined a large blue oak, green with many leaves, somewhere in a field in California. 
I thought of viewing it from a close distance, from underneath its shade, and from far
away on a distant hill. I then imagined these views of the long-frozen tree of _Die blaue Eiche_. 
In picturing these opposite scenes, I felt both unease and longing, which I subsequently set out 
to express musically (in addition to the painting’s loneliness and angularity).

_Near, Under, Far_ was commissioned by _Musaics of the Bay_, San Francisco, California, 
and was composed for cellist Gabriel Cabezas.
