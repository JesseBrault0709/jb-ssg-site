_Arcadia_ was commissioned by _Musaics of the Bay_ and written in response to June 
Yokell's painting entitled _Paradise Lost_. 

When I first saw her painting, I knew immediately that I must compose music from it. 
The colors of the landscape spoke to me directly, reminding me of the geography of 
my childhood home in Western Wisconsin. Arcadia is not only the name of a small town 
in Wisconsin, it is also an ancient Greek word for an ancient, unspoiled wilderness, 
where humans live in harmony with nature.

In 2020, as I looked at the surrounding Wisconsin landscape while composing this work, 
I had feelings of loss, alienation, and sadness. While much of the natural 
world was (and still is) still incredibly beautiful, I had a sense that somehow a metaphorical 
poison had covered the land, rendering it a _Paradise Lost_. _Arcadia_ seeks to capture 
these emotions that I experienced through June's painting in that time.
