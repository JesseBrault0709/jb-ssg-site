This work was written for my dear friend Julia Hamos. 
It is a set of four small pieces, each varying wildly in character:

1. A "celebration", full of radiance, and in a flowing tempo.
2. A bit mysterious, and in a slow, very free tempo. Echoes of Debussy (who himself echoed Wagner).
3. A moderate toccata, alternating between quietly agitated (though somewhat playful) and furioso characters.
4. Slow. Feelings of resignation and loss.
