_Illuminatio_ (Latin for "Illumination") was written in response to "Innovation in the Liberal Arts", 
St. Olaf College's campus theme of the 2012–13 academic year. In the traditional way of thinking about 
the liberal arts, the study of multiple, diverse disciplines can often seem to be a process of merely 
learning a plethora of diverse facts. However, one can recognize this process instead as a deeper 
enlightening, that of becoming aware. The study of diverse lines of thought not only gives one many
different pieces of knowledge, but it heightens one’s perception of the world through experiencing 
many different perspectives of other human beings. The innovation is thus a change of the way one 
thinks about the process of learning in the liberal arts. _Illuminatio_ seeks to capture musically 
this process of expanding one's awareness.

The St. Olaf College Collaborative Undergraduate Research and Inquiry program sponsored my work on _Illuminatio_.

The work was premiered in March 2013 by Dr. Kent McWilliams and the St. Olaf Band, with the composer conducting.
