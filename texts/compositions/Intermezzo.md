This work was written as an homage to composer and friend Will Healy. The bass line of the 
first four measures is taken from the latter half of his piece entitled _The Song I Wanted to Hear_.
I decided to harmonize it with a similarly jazz/post-impressionist influenced sound. Cast in ABA form, 
the middle section winds into a _Liebestod_-esque climax.
